#Notes - Manage your thoughts with a CLI


## Why?
Because why not? We all know, the commandline offers you incredible efficency. Yeah, I know, GUIs come in handy, but hey, real linuxers use bash, ok?

## How?
You write your notes with the text editor of your choice. They may contain Markdown Syntax, MathJax formulas or code snippets. Then, you fire up a web browser and view the results. Or, if you really got balls, you upload it directly to share it with your friends - as html or pdf. Again, your choice.
